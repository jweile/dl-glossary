## S2S
==> Sequence-to-sequence

A sequence-to-sequence (S2S) architecture, is a network architecture that has sequential data (such as text) as both its input and its output. Internally, the input sequences are typically [encoded]("#encoder") in a lower-dimensional context vector. A common example would be a language translation model.
