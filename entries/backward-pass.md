## Backward pass

The calculation of the [gradients](#gradient) of each model parameter relative to the [loss function]("#loss-function") for a given input data batch during [training](#training). This is done using the back-propagation algorithm. Each [batch](#batch) will have undergone a [forward pass]("forward-pass") beforehand in which the loss was calculated.
