## Batch

We canâ€™t pass the entire dataset into the neural net at once. So, we divide dataset into Number of Batches or sets or parts.

Just like we divide a big article into multiple sets/batches/parts like Introduction, Gradient descent, Epoch, Batch size and Iterations which makes it easy to read the entire article for the reader and understand it.
