## RAG
Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines a traditional querying system with an LLM. An interaction with the LLM triggers search queries against a database, repository or even the open internet to retrieve relevant data points or documents which are then "contextualized", i.e. they are worked into the LLMs [context](#context). This allows the LLM to then generate a response taking into account the new information from the search result.
