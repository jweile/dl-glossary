## Embedding

An embedding is a higher-dimensional representation of categorical inputs, such as [tokens]("#token") which their represents hidden semantic features and allows them to be compared. Inputs whose embeddings align (i.e. lie in the same direction in the multidimensional space, as measured by having a small vector dot-product) are implied to have similar semantic meaning. Data is typically translated to its embedding via a look-up table.

Contrast with:

* [Latent space]("#latent-space")
