## Data augmentation

Data augmentation is the practice of artificially generating more training data from a smaller initial training set. The purpose of this practice is to provide a greater variety of training examples in a less cost- and labor-intensive manner.

For example, for image-processing models, one may add rotated, cropped, flipped or color-jittered versions of the original training images. For text data, one may replace synonyms, translate the text to another language and immediately back again ("back-translation"), paraphrasing.
