## CNN
==> Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) uses [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) to connected extract features from local regions of an input. Most CNNs contain a combination of convolutional, [pooling](#pooling) and [affine layers](#affine-layer). CNNs have gained popularity particularly through their excellent performance on visual recognition tasks, where they have been setting the state of the art for several years.
