## Average-Pooling
Average-Pooling is a [pooling](#pooling) technique used in Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition. It works by sliding a window over patches of features, such as pixels, and taking the average of all values within the window. It compresses the input representation into a lower-dimensional representation.
