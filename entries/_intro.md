# The Open Source Deep Learning Glossary

Deep learning terminology can be difficult and overwhelming, especially to newcomers. This glossary tries to define the most commonly used terms.

Since terminology is constantly changing with new terms appearing every day this glossary will be in a permanent work in progress. Feel free to edit or suggest new terms using [issues](https://github.com/jrdi/dl-glossary/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/jrdi/dl-glossary/pulls).
