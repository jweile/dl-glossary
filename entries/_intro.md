# The Open Source Deep Learning Glossary

Deep learning terminology can be difficult and overwhelming, especially to newcomers. This glossary tries to define the most commonly used terms. It was forked and expanded upon from https://github.com/jrdi/dl-glossary.

Since terminology is constantly changing with new terms appearing every day this glossary will be in a permanent work in progress. Feel free to make changes and submit pull requests.

To make editing and adding new entries easier, they can be found as individual markdown files in the `entries/` folder. Using the `makefile` (by calling `make`) will automatically sort, index, and collate them into this `README` file. You can also create a PDF version by calling `make buildPDF` (which requires pandoc and LaTeX to be installed).
