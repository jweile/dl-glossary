## Bias

This word has multiple meanings. It could refer to the [bias term](#bias-term) or model bias.

Model bias is the average difference between the model's predictions and the correct value for that observation?

* **Low bias** could mean every prediction is correct. It could also mean half of your predictions are above their actual values and half are below, in equal proportion, resulting in low average difference.
* **High bias** (with low variance) suggests your model may be underfitting and youâ€™re using the wrong architecture for the job.
