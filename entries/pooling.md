## Pooling
Pooling layers often take convolution layers as input. A complicated dataset with many object will require a large number of filters, each responsible finding pattern in an image so the dimensionally of convolutional layer can get large. It will cause an increase of parameters, which can lead to over-fitting. Pooling layers are methods for reducing this high dimensionally. Just like the convolution layer, there is kernel size and stride. The size of the kernel is smaller than the feature map. For most of the cases the size of the kernel will be 2X2 and the stride of 2. There are mainly two types of pooling layers, [Max-Pooling](#max-pooling) and [Average-Pooling](#average-pooling).
